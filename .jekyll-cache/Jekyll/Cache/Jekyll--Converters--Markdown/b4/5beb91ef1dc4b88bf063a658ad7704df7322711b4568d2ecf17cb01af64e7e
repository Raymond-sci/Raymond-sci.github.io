<!--*Figure 1. Overview of the proposed Anchor Neighbourhood Discovery (AND) method for unsupervised deep learning.*{:.center}--></p>

<p>The goal of video activity localisation is to 
locate temporally video moments-of-interest (MoIs) 
of a specific activity described by a natural language query 
of an untrimmed continuous long video 
(often unscripted and unstructured) that contains many different activities.</p>

<p>Existing video activity localisation solutions
either adopt a proposal-free paradigm to
predict directly the start and end frames of a target moment
that align to the given query,
or a proposal-based paradigm to
generate many candidate proposals for a target moment
and aligns segment-level video features
with the query sentences.
The proposal-free methods deploy directly
the fixed manual activity endpoints labels
for model training, 
implicitly assuming these labels are well-defined.
However,
there is a considerable variation in
how activities occur in unconstrained scenarios,
<em>i.e.</em>, the manual temporal labels are
inherently uncertain and prone to significant misinformation.
On the other hand,
by formulating the localisation task as a matching problem,
the proposal-based methods
consider alignment by the whole moment
with less focus on the exact boundary matching.
Therefore,
it can be less sensitive to the boundary labels
but more reliance on salient content.
Nonetheless,
the problem of detecting accurately the start and end-point
of a target activity moment remains unsolved.</p>

<p>In this work,
we introduce <em>Elastic Moment Bounding</em> (EMB)
to address the limitation of proposal-free paradigm
by modelling explicitly label uncertainty
both in training and testing.
The key idea is that,
considering the uncertain nature of activity temporal boundary,
it is more intuitive to represent the endpoints of video activity
by temporal spans rather than specific frames.
To that end,
the EMB model conducts a proposal-based segment-wise content alignment
in addition to learning of frame-wise boundary identification.
As the predicted segment is required to be 
highly aligned with the query textual description,
we represent the gap between the predicted endpoints and 
the manually labelled endpoints as an elastic boundary
to enable optimal endpoints selection
to be consistent in semantically similar video activities.</p>

<p>Our <em>contributions</em> are: 
<strong>(1)</strong> We introduce a model to 
explore collaboratively both proposal-free and proposal-based mechanisms 
for learning to detect more accurate activity temporal boundary localisation 
when training labels are inherently uncertain. 
We formulate a new Elastic Moment Bounding (EMB) method to 
expand a manually annotated single pair of fixed activity endpoints 
to an elastic set. 
<strong>(2)</strong> To reinforce directly robust content matching 
(the spirit of proposal-based) 
as a condition to accurate endpoints localisation 
(the spirit of proposal-free) of activities in videos, 
we introduce a Guided Attention mechanism to 
explicitly optimise frame-wise boundary visual features 
subject to segment-wise content representations and vice versa.
<strong>(3)</strong> Our EMB model provides a state-of-the-art performance on 
three video activity localisation benchmark datasets, 
improving existing models that 
suffer from sensitivity to uncertainties in activity training labels.</p>
